# AMSEL_robot
This robot will be navigated manually as well as autonomously using the encoder based navigation technique. This robot will capture videos, detect the cracks using deep learning from the frames, take vibration signals and will stream in real-time them to the host PC
using the TCP protocol. The main purpose of this robot is to monitor the structural health of concrete roads.
